### An example lightweight event sourcing system for payments

Supports the following API operations:

- Deposit (account_number, amount)
- Withdraw (account_number, amount)
- Transfer (originator_account, beneficiary_account, amount) 

In this example prohect, the operations payload transform to events and are published to a system of record (in this example, nats streaming).

The Âµservice consumes the events from the system of record, calculates the balance for each account and updates a state database
